## Features

This project includes the following features:
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Hardware connects to android app via Bluetooth for secure and efficient communication.
- **Balance Topup**: Each user has and RFID tag. Clients topup balance on users' RFID tag. On the user screen of android app, client places RFID tag on hardware to launch topup material dialog for balance topup.
- **Register Tag**: Hardware allows clients to register new tags for their users. On the user tag list screen of android app, user places RFID tag on hardware to launch *Register Tag* material dialog to register new tags for users.
- **Voice Propt**: Automated voice promt to welcome and thank users at the start and end of the water vending process respectively.
- **Solar Power**: Solar pawered batteries to keep the hardware system powered

## Software Setup
1. Install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board and port from the **Tools** menu.
4. Create a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.
5. Copy and paste the code from the `water_atm_firmware.ino` file into your sketch.
6. Save the sketch with a meaningful name.

## Usage
1. Upload the **water_atm_firmware.ino** sketch to the Arduino board by clicking the **Upload** button in the Arduino IDE.
2. The LED connected to the Arduino board should start blinking at a fixed interval.
3. Experiment with the code to and customize to suit your needs.
